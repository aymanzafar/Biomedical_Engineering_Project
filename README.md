# Computing Tomography - Reconstructing an Image from Projection Data.

This project demonstrates the process of simulating CT scan image reconstruction using MATLAB. It focuses on modeling a head phantom and reconstructing internal features using Radon transform and inverse Radon techniques.

## 📄 Project Overview
